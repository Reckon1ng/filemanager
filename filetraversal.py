##We are going to traverse the directories recursively, to generate a tree representation of the directory, this will be done with DFS


##We can use BFS if the user wants a specific file (stopping once we hit the node we need)


##We can then focus on tagging by maintaining a list, e.g. the homework tag will look like homework = ["math.tex","abcd.py","weekly_challenge.pdf"]


##With all this done we can then create a GUI layer on top of this
